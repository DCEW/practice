## Quarto- Charlotte's Version

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

Do this instruction instead:

```{r}
5 + 5 

6 + 6

7 + 7
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
